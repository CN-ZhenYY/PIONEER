CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:7 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target PIONEER because files
  in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit directories:

    runtime library [libgomp.so.1] in /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11 may be hidden by files in:
      /usr/local/anaconda3/lib

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
