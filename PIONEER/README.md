## Directory description

- datasets: You can use key-value datasets (e.g. generated by YCSB).
    To enhance dataset reading efficiency on SSDs/PMem, we provide a concurrent read function.
    This function allows reading a dataset with a specified number of rows in parallel, based on the given number of threads.
    To enable this feature, the format of every row in dataset should be as follows:
    Each line has a fixed character count, and the value of $SKIP\_CHARN\_NUMBER$ in $Util.h$ can be adjusted to match this count.

```bash
$  | operation(e.g. insert/search/update/delete) | key | value |
```

## Linux build
All experiments are conducted on a two-socket server running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, equipped with two Intel Xeon Gold 6326 processors (2.9 GHz). To enable the enhanced Asynchronous DRAM Refresh (eADR), the system must utilize 3rd generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors in conjunction with 2nd generation Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory Modules (DCPMM).

### Prerequisites
- install boost and pmdk
- install cmake, g++
- install gflags
### Build and run steps
Modify the parameters in the $test.sh$ file and execute it.
```bash
$ ./test.sh
```
